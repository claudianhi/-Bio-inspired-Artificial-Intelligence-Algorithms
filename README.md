# Bio-inspired-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms


Biology provides a plethora of examples of natural processes and patterns. These processes and patterns have created bio-inspired algorithms meant to address real-world problems. 

This repository consists of bio-inspired algorithm case studies focusing on the applicability of these algorithms. By the completion of these projects, I possess the skills to construct artificial intelligence solutions that can be applied to real-world problems. All of the projects were completed using Python. 

The projects consist of:
1. Genetic Algorithms: Based on biological evolution, this algorithm is one of the most well-known bio-inspired algorithms. Addressing optimization issues, this project aims to minimize the cost of flight schedules and airport wait times.
2. Differential Evolution: Also inspired by biological evolution, this case study focuses on creating a menu and balancing macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins). 
3. Neural Networks: Based on neurons and their neural networks, this project creates a neural network for image classification.
4. Clonal Selection: Using concepts from antibody responses, these are used for digit recognition and generation. 
5. Particle Swarm: This project is inspired by animal social behavior, where the swarm tries to find the best solution to solve a problem. The problem is course schedules, where the resulting algorithm will optimize schedules for max efficiency. 
6. Ant Colony: Based on how ants search for food, this cast study highlights efficiency and leads to the shortest route.
